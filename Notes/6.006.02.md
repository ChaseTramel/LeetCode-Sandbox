## Interface (API) vs. Data Structure

An interface is a specification of what data we can store. Specify what the operations do, what operations are suppported, and what they mean. One can think of this as analagous to a  problem.

A data structure is a represenation of how to store data. Provides algorithms to support operations. One can think of this as analagous to a solution

Two main interfaces:
 - set
 - sequence

 We want to store `n` things. We want to maintain their values and their order.

Two main data structure approaches:
 - arrays
 - pointer-based

## Static sequence interface

We want to support:
 - build(x)
 - len()
 - iter_seq()
 - get_at(i)
 - set_at(i, x)

The (natural) solution to this interface is a static array.
